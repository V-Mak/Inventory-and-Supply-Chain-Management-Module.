# Inventory-and-Supply-Chain-Management-Module

`AI Product/Service Prototyping for Small/Medium Businesses mean startups, single person companies, small community shop chains, local food chains etcs`

## Abstract
* In today’s dynamic business landscape, efficient inventory and supply chain management
play a pivotal role in ensuring the competitiveness and sustainability of organization. This
project introduces a novel Inventory and Supply Chain Management Module empowered by
Machine Learning techniques. The module aims to optimize supply chain processes, reduce
costs, and improve customer satisfaction.
* Key features include demand forecasting, which use ML to predict product demand, leading
to better inventory management. Route optimizations algorithms help streamline deliveries,
reducing transportation expenses. Vendor performance analysis helps identify and improve
supplier relationships.
* In summary, this module empowers organization to make smarter supply chain decisions
using ML, ultimately enhancing efficiency and competitiveness in today’s business
landscape
* Used Small scale code implementation/model building of this Prototype.

`Basically this a Product Ideation task, have to come up with a Business Idea which will primarily use Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence to solve business problems and prepare a report on the abstract prototype/business model`
